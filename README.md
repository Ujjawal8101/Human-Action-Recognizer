# Human-Action-Recognizer

Made a machine learning model that can recognize a variety of human action videos consisting of 10 classes from the
UCF50 dataset.
Used OpenCV for image processing on given video for frame extraction.
Used CNN for extracting spatial features on the extracted frames of the given video.
Used LSTM for temporal feature extraction from the video.
Model got an accuracy of almost **85.44% on training data and 84.16% on testing data** .
